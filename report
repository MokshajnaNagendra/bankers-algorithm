   This is an implementation of the Banker's Algorithm for resource allocation, a deadlock avoidance algorithm.

* The program prompts the user to input the number of processes and resources, as well as the currently available 

   resources and the maximum required resources for each process. Then it calculates the need matrix and checks if 

   there is a safe sequence that can be used to avoid deadlock. If there is a safe sequence, the program executes 

   the processes using threads.

* The "getSafeSeq()" function returns "true" if a safe sequence is found, and "false" otherwise. It works by using a 

   temporary array "tempRes" to store the currently available resources and setting all the processes to be unfinished.

   It then loops until all processes have finished. In each iteration, it checks if there is a process that can be finished 

   safely (i.e., its need is less than or equal to the available resources), and if so, it adds its allocated resources to 
 
   the available resources, marks the process as finished, and adds it to the safe sequence. If no process can be finished 

   safely, it returns "false" to indicate that there is no safe sequence.

* The "processCode()" function is the function that is executed by each thread. It takes an argument "arg" that is a pointer to 

  the index of the process that the thread represents. The function first locks the "lockResources" mutex, and then waits until 

  it is the turn of this process to run (i.e., its index is equal to "getsafeSeq[nProcessRan])". Once it is its turn, it simulates 

  the process by sleeping for a random amount of time between 1 and 3 seconds, and then releases the resources that it was allocated. 

  Finally, it increments "nProcessRan", broadcasts the condition variable "condition", and unlocks the "lockResources" mutex to allow 

  the next process to run.

* Overall, this implementation of the Banker's Algorithm is correct and should work for any valid input. However, it could be improved 

 in various ways, such as by using a data structure to represent the processes and their allocated and required resources instead of using 

 separate arrays, or by adding error checking for invalid input.
